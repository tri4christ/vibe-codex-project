# Scratchpad

- Unfinished thought: explore adding inline toast when Katie skims a step (tie into onboarding store before validation work).
- Unfinished thought: revisit focus-trap implementation; maybe borrow from `@radix-ui/react-dialog` patterns.
- TODO: wire recap export into Playbook activity feed once persistence layer exists.
- TODO: replace `alert()` placeholders in onboarding recap with panel modals or command palette actions.
- Idea to test later: can Scout auto-summarise ICP entries into executive bios for Teamroom cards?
- Idea to test later: run avatar normaliser before pushing new agent art; remember `npm run normalize:avatars`.
- Style vibe: chat bubbles should feel like texting with a real person, not AI â€” keep microcopy warm and human-led.
- Style vibe: maintain rounded-3xl surfaces + soft shadows; avoid sharp dividers unless signaling system alerts.
- Quick command: `npm run dev` for live preview; `npm run preview` to simulate static export.
- Quick command: `npx tsc --noEmit` before shipping onboarding changes to guarantee strict typing holds.
